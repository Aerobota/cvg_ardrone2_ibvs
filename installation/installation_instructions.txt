EXTERNAL LIBRARIES THAT SHOULD BE INSTALLED
#ncurses
sudo apt-get install libncurses5
sudo apt-get install ncurses-bin
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev



DEINSTALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES OF OTHER (OLDER) VERSIONS OF THE STACK
sed -i '/IBVS_WORKSPACE/d' ~/.bashrc
sed -i '/IBVS_STACK/d' ~/.bashrc




NAVIGATE TO WORKSPACE OF ROS (OR CREATE IT)
#example
cd ~/workspace/ros

CREATE A FOLDER FOR THE WHOLE STACK APPLICATION
mkdir -p ~/workspace/ros/cvg_ardrone2_ibvs && cd $_

CREATION OF THE CATKING WORKSPACE and first built
 # if you have ROS groovy then
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
# else if you have ROS hydro then
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
# else if you have ROS indigo then
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
# else if you have ROS jade then
source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash
#common
mkdir src && cd $_
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make


SOURCERING THE STACK
source devel/setup.bash


DOWNLOAD STACK
git clone -b master https://github.com/Vision4UAV/cvg_ardrone2_ibvs.git ./src/quadrotor_stack


INSTALL THE WORKSPACE -> for the setup.sh
./src/stack/installation/installers/installWS.sh


INSTALL THE STACK -> for the launchers and the logs
cd src/quadrotor_stack
./installation/installers/installStack.sh

#close terminal and reopen it, or alternatively execute
source ~/.bashrc

DOWNLOAD REQUIRED PACKAGES OF THE STACK -> This step is slow, so, be patient!
cd $IBVS_STACK
git submodule update --init

COMPILE STACK
cd $IBVS_STACK
source setup.sh
cd $IBVS_WORKSPACE
catkin_make

#we have noticed that it sometimes fails when compiling, because an error in the external package ros_opentld. If it fails, run "catkin_make" again. It solved all our problems from the moment!


OPENING STACK with qtcreator
cd $IBVS_WORKSPACE/src
rm CMakeLists.txt
cp /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake CMakeLists.txt
cd ..
source devel/setup.bash
qtcreator
#put the build folder in the correct path!
